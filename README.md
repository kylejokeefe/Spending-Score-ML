# Spending Score ML
Using information from a dataset on Kaggle, I explored the data, prepared it for a machine learning algorithm, and applied both linear regression and decision tree regressor to predict outcomes. MAE is higher than I like so fine tuning will still be needed. There isn't strong correlations seen in the data so ultimately, accuracy might be hard to bring up
